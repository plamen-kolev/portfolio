My responsibilities at The Hut Group were to develop their propriatery Warehouse Management Platform that is responsible for shipping thousands of products each day from their warehouses.

The stack that I worked in was Java 8 event-based *microservices* deployed on AWS cluster.

The job was very challenging due to the warehouses operating at full capacity 24 hours each day. There I provided support as an on-call engineer, troubleshooting difficult problems during outages and live issues.

Due to the complexity of the software, it was hard to simulate certain behaviours (shipment arriving in the warehouse, storage request for a product, etc.) and it was a manual process when testing. I identified that we can create an automation tool that can provide 'cookbooks' for a variety of scenarios. As a result, this helped us troubleshoot live issues as well as catch bugs in development stages by writing these simulations, which decreased our cycle time and improved the defect age.
