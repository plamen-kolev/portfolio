I used my experience at Intel to created a platform for secure deployment, management and monitoring of virtual servers as part of BSC final year dissertation. 

The platform aimed to provide the same functionality as *AWS*'s *EC2*.
Technologies used: *Puppet*, *BASH* shell, *Virtualbox*, *Vagrant*, *Ruby* and *Ruby On Rails*.  
The project is now open-source and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/plamen-kolev/Software-Engineer-Dissertation)
