Worked on the Landing Pages team as a *Full-Stack developer* for the biggest hotel booking company in the world. I worked on a large scale replatforming project that managed to increase the scalability, performance, accessibility and development speed of the platform.
The work involved breaking a large monolithic *Java* application into small data-driver dockerized *microservices*. The technology used was *Java SpringBoot* for the API data layer, *NodeJS* and *React* for the presentation layer.

* Created and integrated a reusable front-end search box component that is currently used by Ryanair to book vehicles during the flight purchasing process.  
* As part of the team, I was responsible for putting over a million landing pages onto the new platform, enabling over 10 000 customers per day to have an improved experience.  
* Improved the platform's reliability, alerting and monitoring by implementing *Prometheus* metrics and *Jaeger* Tracing into our solution. These metrics enabled us to create monitoring dashboards and alerted us during live issues, slow network traffic or outages.
