Worked on the Landing Pages team in a large scale replatforming project that managed to increase the scalability, performance, accessibility and development speed of the platform.

As part of the team, I was responsible for putting every airport page (over 10 000 pages) onto the new platform, enabling over 1 000 customers per day to have an improved experience.  
I have also worked on improving the platform's reliability, alerting and monitoring by implementing *Prometheus* metrics and *Jaeger* Tracing into our solution.

My experience at Booking has given me the opportunity to write full-stack software solutions by using *NodeJs* Javascript framework and *React*.
