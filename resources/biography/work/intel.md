worked on high-performing, Cyber Security project. 
My responsibilities were to extend the in-house automation framework, which is responsible for ensuring that the Data Loss Prevention and Email threat detection engine cannot be exploited by attackers.

I was responsible for extending the framework, which was written in *Perl*, as well as creating new automation test suits. I would also troubleshoot software bugs by using the *BASH* scripting language and an array of built-in *Linux* command line tools in a *virtualized* environment.

At Intel, I was given the task to write a UI automation framework using *Perl* and *Selenium Web Drier*. I managed to deliver the solution on time and presented during training sessions on how the testing engineers can use it.
