* Worked on high-performing, Cyber Security project. 
My responsibilities were to extend the in-house automation framework, which is responsible for ensuring that the Data Loss Prevention and Email threat detection engine cannot be exploited by attackers.
* Created new automation test suits as well as managed existing test scenarios using the *Perl* programming language. 
* Used *BASH* scripting language and built-in *Linux* command-line tools to find and troubleshoot software bugs in the product.
* Delivered a UI automation framework using *Perl* and *Selenium Web Driver*. The tool was used by the testing engineers to create test suits, ensuring we do not introduce visual or functional regression for our customer-facing components. After the solution was delivered, I created training sessions to teach the testing team about the tool and how to utilise it.
