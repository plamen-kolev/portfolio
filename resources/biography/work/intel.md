Worked on high-performing, Cyber Security project at Intel Security. 
My responsibilities were to extend the in-house automation framework, which is responsible for ensuring that the Data Loss Prevention and Email threat detection engine cannot be exploited by attackers.

* Created new automation test suits as well as managed existing test scenarios using the *Perl* programming language. 
* Used *BASH* scripting language and built-in *Linux* command-line tools to find and troubleshoot software bugs in the product.
* Delivered a UI automation framework using *Perl* and *Selenium Web Driver*. The tool was used by the testing engineers to create test suits, ensuring we do not introduce visual or functional regression for our customer-facing components. After the solution was completed, I created training sessions and taught the testing team how to use the tool.
