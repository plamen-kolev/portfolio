* At The Hut Group I was responsible for developing a proprietary Warehouse Management Platform, responsible for shipping thousands of products every day from warehouses located around the world.
* The tech stack was *Java* 8 and *SpringBoot* event-driver *microservices* deployed on *AWS* that we managed.
* Provided 24 hour support as an on-call engineer and troubleshooting difficult problems during outages and live issues out of hours.
* Created an algorithm for optimising crane retrieval movements, which made it 20% more cheap and efficient to pull stock from storage.
* Led an initiative to create a solution for warehouse simulations, which allowed the team to troubleshoot live issues as well as catch bugs in early stages during testing. The solution also helped us improve our defect age and decreased development cycle time.
