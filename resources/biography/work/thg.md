My responsibilities at The Hut Group were to develop their proprietary Warehouse Management Platform that is responsible for shipping thousands of products each day from their warehouses located across the world.

The stack that I worked in was *Java* 8 event-based *microservices* deployed on our *AWS* cluster.

The job was very challenging due to the warehouses operating at full capacity 24 hours every day. I provided support as an on-call engineer, troubleshooting difficult problems during outages and live issues both during work and out of hours.

Due to the complexity of the warehouse software, a lot of time was wasted in manual testing. I identified that we can create an automation tool and as a result, I led an initiative to create a solution for warehouse simulations.

It helped us troubleshoot live issues as well as catch bugs in development. It also led to decreased development cycle time and improved our defect age.
