I used the knowledged that I picked up at Intel to created a platform for deployment, management and monitoring of virtual servers as part of BSC final year dissertation. 

The platform aimed to provide the same functionality as *AWS*'s *EC2*
Technologies used: *Puppet*, *BASH* shell, *Virtualbox*, *Vagrant*, *Ruby* and *Ruby On Rails*.
