My name is Plamen Kolev and I specialize in web application development, system automation and software deployment. I have over 3 years of experience working in world leading companies as a software engineer.  

I am a strong team player and like taking initiative and ownership of the work that I do. I have experience with established technologies such as Enterprise *Java*, *Perl*, *Ruby*, *Bash*, *Linux* and *MYSQL* databases.  
I have also worked with new and emerging technologies such as *Docker*, *Hazelcast*; in-memory data grid, *AWS*: Amazon Web Services, *React* and *NodeJS*. In my
professional experience, I have used established software engineering patterns to deliver high quality, reliable, and robust software.

I use *Scrum* and *Agile* methodologies to deliver incremental and sustainable solutions and have practised extreme programming, pairing and mobbing to create higher-quality, mature software. I also have experience in *TDD*: Test Driven Development.  

*Linux* is an important part of my developer toolbox and I can use the build in tools to efficiently automate and speed up developer tasks.  
I have strong grasp of advanced *Git* version control features and can utilise them to effectivly collaborate in a team.
