My name is Plamen Kolev and I specialize in web application development, system automation, and software deployment. I have over 3 years of experience working in world-leading companies as a Software Engineer.  

I am a strong team player and like taking initiative and ownership of my work. I have experience with established technologies such as Enterprise *Java*, *Perl*, *Ruby*, *Bash*, *Linux* and *MYSQL* databases.  
My experience with new and emerging technologies is working with *Docker*, *Hazelcast*; in-memory data grid, *Amazon Web Services*, *React* and *NodeJS*. In my professional experience, I have used established software engineering patterns to deliver high quality, reliable, and robust software.

I have developed software using *Scrum* and *Agile* methodologies such as pairing and mobbing to create high-quality, mature software. I also have experience doing *Test-Driven Development*. 

*Linux* is an important part of my developer toolbox and I can use the build-in tools to efficiently automate and speed up developer tasks.  
I have strong grasp of advanced *Git* version control features and can utilise them to effectively collaborate in a team.
