I specialize in web application development, system automation, and software deployment. I have over 3 years of experience working in world-leading companies as a Software Engineer.  

I am a strong team player and like taking initiative and ownership of my work. In my professional experience, I have used established software engineering patterns to deliver high quality, reliable, and robust software.

I have developed software using *Scrum* and *Agile* methodologies such as pairing and mobbing to create high-quality, mature software. I have experience doing *Test-Driven Development*. 

I have strong grasp of advanced *Git* version control features and can utilise them to effectively collaborate in a team.
